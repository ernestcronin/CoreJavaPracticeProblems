/**
 * 12. There are two parts: 
 * 
 * a. Generate a DoubleStream using the of() method
 * consisting of the numbers 0, 2 and 4. Note that this stream is a stream of
 * primitives and not a stream of types. Filter in odd numbers only and sum the
 * remaining stream. You should get 0. (QID 2.2024) 
 * 
 * b. Using 1.0 and 3.0,
 * generate a stream of Doubleâ€™s. Map them to primitive doubleâ€™s. Filter in even
 * numbers only and calculate the average. Output the result without running the
 * risk of generating an exception.
